              <p>What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.</p>
              <p>Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?</p>
              <p>Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out.
